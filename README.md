# LearnX Chain

## Introduction to LearnX Chain
LearnX Chain (LearnX) is a decentralized, high-efficiency and energy-saving public chain. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high- performance transactions. The endogenous token of LearnX is LEX and it adopts the LPoS consensus mechanism. LearnX will continue to improve the efficiency of Ethereum by Layer2, which will supplement and empower the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Declaration
To help developers’ evolvement at every stage 

## Vision
Technological innovation is the driving force behind the advancement of the blockchain industry, but many innovative projects have been misunderstood and ignored at their early stages. We have witnessed the growth process of great projects. Recalling that Ethereum and Polkadot were questioned as altcoins in the early days, they all went through difficult times. Therefore, LearnX's mission is not only a public chain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, LearnX is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## LearnX’s Performance
- TPS: 2000+
- Average block interval: 3s

## Consensus Mechanism
LPoS consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 21.

## Economic Model 
The endogenous token on the chain is HT; the transactions consume LEX as gas fee.

Miners pledge LEX to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion. 


## Meta Transaction Function
The meta-transaction function is supported, which allows users to reduce gas fees step-wise, and LearnX will cover the payment of the reduced part. The meta-transaction function allows to minimize the migration cost of DApp developers, as well as to effectively reduce the cost of DApp users.

## LearnX Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.


 
### Financial Support
- LearnX will set up a special fund to invest, support and incentivize high-potential developers.
- LearnX will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to discover and fund potential developers. 
- In order to reduce the cost of users on LearnX Dapp, the LearnX meta transaction function will reduce the gas fee of users holding LEX in a step-wise manner.

### Resource Support
- Projects or developers that have received investment and support from LearnX have not only the opportunity to get official news report, but also can apply for marketing service packages and promote their projects globally.
- High-quality projects can participate in LearnX global roadshows for free.
- LearnX fund will open up ecological resources to high-potential developers, matching the win-win cooperation between developers and our ecological partners.
